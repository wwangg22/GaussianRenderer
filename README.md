# Project Goals

## Overview
This project focuses on building a high-performance Gaussian Renderer with support for both standard 3D and extended 4D (spacetime) Gaussians. The emphasis is on efficiency and speed beyond existing baseline renderers.

---

## Objectives
- [ ] Build a 3D Gaussian Renderer  
- [ ] Support 4D Gaussians (Spacetime Gaussians)  
- [ ] Optimize performance to be more efficient/faster than the default 3D Gaussian Renderer  

---

## Deliverables
- Working 3D Gaussian Renderer implementation  
- Extended 4D Gaussian rendering support  
- Benchmarking results showing performance gains  

---

## Success Criteria
- 3D renderer matches or exceeds baseline quality  
- 4D spacetime rendering works correctly with test cases  
- Benchmarks demonstrate improved efficiency over the default implementation  

---

## Stretch Goals
- Real-time rendering support  
- Integration with interactive viewers (VR/AR/WebGL)  
- Memory-efficient Gaussian data storage  

---

## Notes
- Dependencies: CUDA / OpenGL / Vulkan (TBD)  
- Risks: Optimization complexity, GPU compatibility  
- Future Work: Multi-GPU scaling, neural field integration
